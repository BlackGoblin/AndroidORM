# AndroidORM

This project is divided into two main parts:
- an ORM that creates SQLite database tables from models. (This part is not implemented yet)
- a Helper class that does the simple CRUD operations.

All you need to do is implement BaseEntity in your modles and introduce your model package. everything eles is taken care of by AndroidORM.
